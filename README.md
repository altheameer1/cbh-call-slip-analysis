# cbh-call-slip-analysis

As a fellow at the Center for Brooklyn History Othmer Library, I undertook a long-term project to record and analyze data from the call slips used to request archival materials.

First, I created a spreadsheet and entered the appointment date, collection name & call number, box number and pull date from over 1,000 paper call slips, creating a dataset that represented over a year of patron research activities at the CBH library. Using what I was learning in my Programming for Cultural Heritage course at Pratt, I then wrote a Python script to analyze the data and create smaller data sets showing information about how much each collection was used and displaying patterns in patron behavior.
